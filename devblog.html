                    Today I worked on the about me section for a while and moved a few passages around to different pages. I added a form at the bottom of the homepage where people can easily contact me should they wish to. I started refreshing my CSS skills by following along another crash course 
                    by the same Youtube channel (link attached below) and started to mess around with different styles.

                <p>I decided to start programming in html just to practice my coding and I thought it would be nice to have a place 
                    to document my journey as an engineer. I followed a crash course on html5 to get the basics down and started to get 
                    my professional history and education added onto my about me page. I then started messing with the formatting and called it a night.
